# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This repo is for the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of `run_analysis.R` is called `tidy_data.txt`, and uploaded in the repo.

Note: The script takes for granted all the data is present under your R working directory, un-compressed and without names changed.
